## Chapter 1

### Questions
1. What are some differences between official and unofficial project managers?
2. Why do fewer than half of all projects actually meet their goals?
3. What are the signs of a successful project?
4. What does it mean to “manage projects” but to “lead people”?
5. “Whether it’s a $50,000 study or a $30 billion ‘giga’ project, the basic tenets of project management should not change.” What’s true about that statement?

### Answers
1. Unofficial project managers differ from official project managers in the sense that the "unofficial" ones are not really project managers on paper, for example, a website manager, but is taking tasks and responsibilities aligned with project delivery and management, such as delivering products (in this case, website features) on time and within scope, and is involved in the planning and implementation of project products, such as site features as previously mentioned.
   
2. Most projects, and more so with projects that are handled by organizations who have few project management principles and methods being used, can have different causes of failure to meet project goals, some examples being the lack of planning, lack of commitment by the organization, and the lack of apparent project leadership, which can lead to dissatisfied and/or disillusioned project members.
   
3. Some signs of a successful project are the following; first, if they either meet the performance goals and expectations set for the project; second, if the project has well-optimized resources; and third, if the project seems to be fostering high morale and confidence for the members.
   
4. In a project management standpoint, we should be managing projects, its planning, scheduling, and delivery, which in turn subjects the project into metrics that are quantifiable. However, we shouldn't be really trying to subject the people involved in the project to the same metrics; instead, we should do our best as project managers to foster confidence and morale within the members through interpersonal communication.
   
5. The statement is true in the sense that the basic tenets of project management should never change, because projects have the SAME core principles and deliverables no matter how simple or complicated the project is.

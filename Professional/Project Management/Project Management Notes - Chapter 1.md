# What is a Project?
- Some people mistake *projects* from *operations*, which are technically NOT the same thing
- Projects are transient, operations are day-to-day, but even some industries have projects as part of the day-to-day
- The academe definition: a small, temporary organization within an organization working and contributing for a beneficial and significant change
- APM definition: unique and transient endeavor taken to achieve a desired outcome
- The British Standard definition: a unique process containing controlled and coordinated activities with set start and end dates, undertaken with the goal of achieving objectives with set requirements which include constraints but not limited to time, budget, and resources

> [!NOTE] My Takeaway
> What seems to be common between the definitions of a *project* is that while it might be *temporary*, it is unique (all projects are, on different factors) and is set up for the goal of achieving a very significant change within an organization, and are bound by constraints, schedules, and requirements.

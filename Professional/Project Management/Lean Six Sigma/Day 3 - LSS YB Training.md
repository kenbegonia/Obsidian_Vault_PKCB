# Lean Six Sigma
- Used for chronic, systemic problems
- For problems that have unknown solutions
- Manage and crop scopes, divide problems into different areas of scope
- Do not create false expectations

# DMAIC: Analyze

## 7. Identify Potential Causes
It's important to find what's causing the problem in the project.

### Y is a function of X
- Y = problem
- X = process

- Do not rely only on KPIs
- Listen to people
- We need to learn and walk the process
- Formulate and check the hypothesis

### Identifying Wastes
- Defects
- Overproduction
- Waiting
- Non-utilized Talent
- Transport
- Inventory
- Motion
- Extra Processing

| Defects                      | Overproduction                                                              | Waiting                                                                       | Non-utilized Talent                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Chef is using expired olives | Whenever they receive an order of 10 pizzas, they produce 12 *just in case* | Chef's assistant is idle 50% of the time waiting ingredients from the kitchen | Waiter is actually adept in making special pizzas gaining certification abroad |

| Transport                                                            | Inventory                                        | Motion                                                                     | Extra Processing                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long delivery time to get ingredients from supermarket to restaurant | Way too much cheese waiting to be used in pizzas | Chef moves a lot from freezer to the oven; basically layout is inefficient | Chef's assistant is spending 1 minute per olive to place 8 olives perfectly symmetrical in each pizza slice |

### Ishikawa Diagram
- Used to check for different potential aspects and causes of what makes a process, or outputs, defective
- Method, Manpower

| Method          | Manpower            | Material           |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Recipe is wrong | Chef is not trained | Olives are expired |

| Machine        | Measurement          | Mother Nature    |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Oven is broken | Thermostat is broken | Kitchen is dirty |

## 8. Prioritize Potential Causes

### Pairwise Comparison
- Make a matrix of possible causes paired to each other in a Cartesian plane (x, y)
- Utilize feedback from experts related to the possible causes whether one cause outweighs the other
- Get the total number of mentions per possible cause
- Get the total number of all mentions
- Get the percentages represented by: `number of mentions per possible cause / number of total mentions`

Combining workplace with data is the best representative of the voice of the leader/boss/CEO.

### Qualitative Approach
- Data can validate qualitative assumptions
- We indeed need to also use quantitative approaches
- Data is important, but also never forget 

### Analytic Hierarchic Process


### Who Should We Consider
- People who are handling and touching the process involved for a long time (tenured project members)

## 9. Validate Root Causes
A/B Testing is one way to validate root causes
- A variant example: pizza with expired olives
- B variant example: pizza with fresh olives
- Null and alternative hypothesis

Also try to run pilot tests to compare and gather data for null and alternative hypothesis

Assignment: search about root cause validation with data

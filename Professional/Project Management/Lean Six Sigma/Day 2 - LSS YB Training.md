# DMAIC: Measure

---

## Investigate Measurement Systems

#### Precision and Accuracy
- `Accuracy` of data is more valued than the `precision` of the data
- Accu

#### Repeatability

## Running Control Charts

#### How do we know if data is stable?
- If data does not go past the `control limits` (lower, upper)
- Data can also be used for risk analysis

#### Special Conversation: Sampling
- Samples are just a portion of the whole data
- Consider the margin of error when sampling data
- Sample should minimally mimic, or represent, the data population
- Sample size is `NOT` the only dimension of data sampling

#### Sampling Dimensions
1. *Sample Size*: Sample must be `sufficient` in size in regard to data points
2. *Time of Collection*: Sample must also be `contextual`; relevant to what you need
3. *Reliability*: Sample must be `reliable` and taken from properly from sources
4. *Segmentation*: Sample must be `well segmented` and meets research objectives
5. *Randomness*: Sample must be taken `random` and not cherry-picked

## Running Capability Analysis

#### Some Stuff to Study on the Side
- CPK
- PPK
- PPM
- Sigma Level
- Process Capability Analysis
- Binomial Capability Analysis

#### What Does Negative Sigma Level Mean?
- This means that process is, or might be, broken in terms of the dimensions/factors/benchmarks set for the process

#### What Does Low Sigma Level Mean?
- This means that the process is not that broken, but is indeed in need of improvements in regards to the benchmarks set for the process

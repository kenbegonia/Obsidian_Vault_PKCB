# Official Draft
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Junior Business Analyst (Software Development) position at Old.St Labs. With over four years of combined experience in Shopify site management and quality assurance, and pairing that background with success in translating business goals and requirements into technical details, I believe that my background is ready for a level-up to the Business Analyst role.

Even though my current role is centered on Shopify e-commerce site management, I have been also taking on responsibilities that would best align with business analyst functionalities, such as identifying customer pain points within our website, translating non-technical visions of the upper management for our sales campaigns into technical requirements that we as a team need to achieve, and cross-functional communication and collaboration with the upper management, the marketing, and the customer teams to ensure that our site goals are achieved.

Given this, a level-up transition into the Junior Business Analyst role is a natural next step for me since with this role, I would be eager to apply all the analytical, cross-functional communication, and stakeholder engagement skills I've learned and developed within my current role for the past few years.

What excites me the most about working with Old.St Labs is that they strive for transparency, communication, and quality. These important commitments align perfectly and resonates deeply with my current professional values, and I'm more than enthusiastic about the opportunity of learning more under the guidance of your Product Managers while having meaningful contributions to your app development and digital transformation initiatives.

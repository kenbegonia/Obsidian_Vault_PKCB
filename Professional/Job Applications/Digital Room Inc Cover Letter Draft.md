## Official Draft
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Associate Product Manager position at Digital Room (Philippines), Inc. While I am still early in my formal product management career, my combined background in Shopify site management, quality assurance, and project coordination at my current role has already given me practical experience that closely aligns with the responsibilities of this role.

In my current role, I have partnered cross-functionally with teams to translate business needs and visions into actionable tasks, and ensure that these improvements directly support our daily operations and customer service. My QA background has trained me to analyze our systems and site experience critically, and suggest improvements that can help make our systems and tools more effective in the long run in a business perspective. I also take pride in bringing structure and organization to projects while simultaneously ensuring that our processes and outputs are user-friendly and aligns with our business goals.

I am eager to contribute these skills to your team while continuing to grow as a product manager. I would be glad to discuss how I can add value to your organization, and thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Paul Kenneth Begonia

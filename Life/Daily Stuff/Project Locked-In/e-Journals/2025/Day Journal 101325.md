## What's up today?

### Fitness
Good stuff for today, I guess? Energy seems to be way too off to have motivation for studying, so I'll be toning the workouts down to conserve what little energy I have weekly, given that I'm technically the only *able-bodied* person in this household. Here's what was done:

>[!tip] Workouts Done: October 13, 2025
>1) Hardcore warmup: 80 kettlebell swings, 10 posterior leg swings, 10 sweepers, 10 knee raises
>2) 30 minute Japanese walk method

Might be a wee bit dangerous since I haven't done a proper cooldown after these.

### Studies
Got to start reading on `Project Management for Unofficial Project Managers` to kickstart my transition to project management earlier this day. Honestly, this is way too overdue since I was already *planning* this move MONTHS before this day (originally, I wanted to get out of my current role *before* July), but there should be no such thing as 'too late'. Since this day is the actual start of my transition journey to PM, I might be starting to leave study logs tomorrow.

### Current Work
As per usual, my work sucks. I mean, I love my *role*, but I don't love the organization. I dunno, I still feel like the company's WAY all over the place when it comes to what they want and what they need from me, from my role, besides actually managing the site, managing my own workload (yes, this is a MUST when you want to become a PM), and reaching out to different external stakeholders of the apps we use for the platform. 

To be honest, I can just wing it

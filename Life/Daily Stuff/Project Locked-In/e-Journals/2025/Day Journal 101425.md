## What's up today?

### Life in General
I wanted to have a morning walk for today, but since I went to sleep too late at around 12AM and it was raining at 6AM in the morning, I just slept in through my alarms. It kinda sucks that I slept in considering I could've taken an early at-home workout, but since it was raining, I think it was too comfy to get out of bed early.

Anyway, Bubba's interview with Coforge is today. Had to drive her to Northgate for her job interview, but cannot fetch her from there since Goldie doesn't have much fuel left, and I don't even have money to fill her up again, not until tomorrow -- that is, if Keval will pay up on time. Bummer.

# 🧹 Micro-Decluttering Plan (Personal Stuff)

## 🎯 Goal
Clear your personal clutter and create calm zones to improve focus and prepare for future move.

## 🗓️ Weekly Decluttering Routine (15–30 mins/day, 4–5x/week)

|-----|-------------|
| Mon | Clothes |
| Tue | Desk / Study Corner |
| Wed | Gear & Gadgets (cables, tech, gym stuff) |
| Thu | Toiletries & Grooming |

## 🔨 Decluttering Method
1. Take everything out of the space.
2. Sort into 3 piles:
   - ✅ Keep & Use
   - 📦 Box for Move
   - 🗑️ Toss / Donate / Sell
3. After each session, box and label clearly.

## 🧠 Tips
- Progress over perfection—15–30 mins daily adds up.
- Reclaim clarity, not just cleanliness.
- Use a "Declutter Box" for unsure items, revisit weekly.

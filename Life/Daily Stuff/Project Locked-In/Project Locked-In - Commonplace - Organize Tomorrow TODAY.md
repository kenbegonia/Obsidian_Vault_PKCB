# 1. Get The Most Important Things Done Daily
- We should not try to focus on getting more things done on the daily
- We should instead focus on getting the important things done consistently
- In line with the Pareto principle where 80% of the outcomes come from the 20% of the efforts, we need to practice the fact that we need to determine the “20%” among our to-do lists

# 2. Determine The “Three Most Important”
- To determine the above mentioned 20%, we can use the “Three Most Important” list filter
- The “Three Most Important” filter is the three most impactful tasks you need to do for the day
- Among the three, you can also determine which is the “One Must”, which is to say the most important among the three important tasks

# 3. Don't Let The List Wait Until End of Day
- Successful people plan with and around emergencies in mind
- It is very much advisable to finish the "Three Most Important" in the morning, or during the first few hours of shift (if the list is for work)

# 4. Why It Works
- This method works since our brains are wired to prepare for successfully closing open loops, and by definition, open important tasks are technically open loops
- When we have open loops, this could bring anxiety about the nearest future which is 'tomorrow', and having the "Three Most Important" can help us, in a way, in regards to that short term anxiety

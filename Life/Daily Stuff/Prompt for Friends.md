Hello again, Vatsalya! Replying to this since I'll be relaying a related issue here.

It was reported to us by a team member that someone has still managed to get through the tag and add the product to their carts (when they're not supposed to). What we've seen happening is that the CTA appears for a second or two before it disappears, GIF attached on this email as proof, and we think that this might be how they're able to pull the exploit off.

In light of what's happening with the CTA, can the disappearance load time be reduced, by any chance? Or are there other underlying reasons for the delay to be happening? Your input's very much appreciated!

Cheers,
Ken

Hi tito Jack, nalock po si AJ sa FB account nya kaya lalo syang di makasend. Nagmessage lang din po kasi may ibang parte na din ng tubo na naglleak, meron na din doon sa may gilid malapit sa kapitbahay. Nilagyan na din po namin nung interior na balot yung nandon. Ano na kayang next step neto tito? Hindi rin po namin masabi kila tito jun kasi nga po locked out si AJ sa FB haha need na po bang ireplace lahat? Hindi rin po namin mashoulder ung cost kung need na palitan ee. Thanks po tito!

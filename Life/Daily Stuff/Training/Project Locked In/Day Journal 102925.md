## What's up today?

### Life in General
It's been a while since I've put in an e-journal entry. To be honest, the last week had been very much lackluster and draining, at least on my end. I've been feeling stuck, talking about career and studies-wise. It's already the 29th of October, and given that I've already planned to resign around the same time last year, it hasn't been really fruitful. 

Too much to do in Cavite just to survive; just to live *comfortably* right after work. Still defeated the purpose of living. I'm still tired at the end of the day, still can't study, still can't prepare for a career move. Ruel's employer hasn't reached out yet; it's already been two weeks in. I don't think it's gonna work for me, at least application-wise. Welp, more time for me to prepare for the next role.

To be honest, I do NOT know what's stopping me from locking in; I think it's the atmosphere in the Cavite house, and me getting too tired from working, running errands (if needed), and maintaining the house interior. I can't even maintain the front lawn, we're almost getting overran by wild melons growing everywhere near the pines; only the regular driveway sweeps permit with my energy levels there.

Maybe my anxiety also contributes to my energy depletion? Heck, I always get anxious when talking about money and emergency expenditures.

The light at the end of the tunnel is that Bubba was already hired by Coforge, and to be honest, I'm more than proud of her. I know she can learn what she still lack on the fly.

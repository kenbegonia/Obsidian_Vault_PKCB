### 🔥 **Shoulders**

1. **Front Raises** (palms down or thumbs up):
    
    - Targets the front delts.
        
    - Great paired with walking for posture and core engagement.
        
2. **Lateral Raises to 90°** (strict form):
    
    - Use light dumbbells or resistance bands.
        
    - Focus on pausing at the top to increase time under tension.
        
3. **Shoulder External Rotations** (elbows tucked at 90°):
    
    - Band or light dumbbell, rotate hands outward.
        
    - Strengthens rotator cuff muscles.

### 👊 **Core Isolation Add-ons**

While not classic "isolation," these add core engagement:

- **Overhead holds** while walking (with dumbbells or bands)
    
- **Cross-body punches** (light weights, slow and controlled)
    
- **Pallof Press Walks** (with a resistance band anchored to the side)

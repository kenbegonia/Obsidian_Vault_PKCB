# Essential Cheats For Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3

Technically, these are only to be used on PCSX2 gameplays of **Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3**.

These cheats will not work on a regular PS2, since you'll be needing these codes to be put in a cheat engine, like the ones built-in on the PCSX2.

## How Do I Activate The Cheats?

1. First of all, you need to have the PNACH file under the 'Cheats' folder of the PCSX2 files folder. You'll need the file to store all of the cheats you'll need for a certain PS2 game, and in this case, **Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3**. If you don't have one, PCSX2's current version/build will ask you if you want it to create one for you. To do that, go to the `Tools` tab on the PCSX2 when the game is running, then select the `Edit Cheats...` option. Just answer *yes* to the prompt.

2. Next, when the PNACH file is created, open the file with a code editor, like Notepad++ or VS Code. I'm using N++ on my end. Copy the desired cheat codes to the file. You can use the ones I've provided below.

3. Now, after copying the codes to the PNACH file, save it. 

4. After saving, now go to the `Settings` tab, then select the `Game Properties` option. A modal will appear.
   
5. On the modal, go to the `Cheats` tab. You'll see the list of the cheats found on the PNACH file, along with tick boxes on their side. Just tick the cheats you need to be activated on your session.

## Where Are The Cheats, You Say?

Chill! Here goes the cheats you need, especially if you want to complete **Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3** with 100% completion, since technically there was a mistranslation/localization bug from Japanese to the Western copies, which made the appearance requirements of certain opponents like **Whirlwind Fanfare** (the most infamous one out there between them two) virtually impossible to achieve with *normal* progression in the Western copies of the game.

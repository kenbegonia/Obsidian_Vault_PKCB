## Official Draft
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Web Content Operations Specialist position at Balsam Brands. With over four years of combined experience in Shopify site management and quality assurance, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, attention to detail, and commitment to creating seamless user experiences.

In my current role, I have honed my skills in content management systems, specifically Shopify, and developed a strong foundation in site management. From minimizing internal redirects, to fixing broken links to ensure seamless navigation, both to enhance core web vitals, I have continuously contributed to improving website performance and SEO metrics for my current company’s website. Working on time-sensitive projects like large-scale sale campaigns has strengthened my ability to adapt quickly and deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines while collaborating with cross-functional teams spanning marketing, creatives, and site management.

Beyond the technical aspects, my role also involved reviewing blog entries and product listing photos for accuracy and alignment with design protocols, ensuring content meets established company standards. My professional background also includes working with a US-based company, highlighting my English proficiency and ability to work effectively in diverse, global teams.

Also, as someone who has been recently certified as a Yellow Belt in Lean Six Sigma, I do also hope to impart what I've learned to help with the backend process improvements for your website(s) and webpages.

What excites me the most about working with Balsam Brands is that they strive for excellence, that they provide opportunities for professionals who want to make an impact within a people-first workplace, and that they value doing the right thing most. These important commitments align perfectly with my current professional values, and I believe that this alignment provides synergy and will make working with the team both fulfilling and productive.

I am eager to bring my expertise and passion for impactful web content and experience to Balsam Brands. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your mission and discuss how my skills can support your goals. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Paul Kenneth Begonia

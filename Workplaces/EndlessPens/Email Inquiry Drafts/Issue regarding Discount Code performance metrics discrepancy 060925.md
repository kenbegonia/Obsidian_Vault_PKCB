Hello and good day to you, team!

This is Ken from EndlessPens. I'd like to raise an issue regarding a discrepancy in the performance metrics of one of our Discount Codes. 

To start, here's a link of our Discount Code in question: https://admin.shopify.com/store/endlesspens/discounts/1238174302384

What happened is that this Discount Code shows that it had USD630 in total sales, while showing '0 used' in the usage metrics. I'll be also attaching a screenshot of the issue (file name: discount-code-metric-discrepancy.png).

Your inputs regarding what might happened or what could've caused this error would be greatly appreciated!


Cheers,
Ken

# Draft:

Hello and good day!

I'm Ken from EndlessPens' site team! I'd like to inquire if the cross-sell functionality has an option to have products coming from an external data source, like from another wishlist app that we have on our store? For now, what I can only see on the cross-sell blocks as options would be from either the Shopify algorithm or from a manually-curated list and/or store collections.

If not, can we request this as a feature instead? Your input would be very much appreciated!

Thanks,
Ken

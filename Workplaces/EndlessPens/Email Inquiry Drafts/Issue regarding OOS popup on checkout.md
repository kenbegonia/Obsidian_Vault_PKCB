hallo @twenty_sides!! what seems to be the problem kaya dito? I tried counterchecking inventories for the affected product of the customer, inventory stocks are all good for the variant. Also took a look at some forums in Shopify with the similar problem, most of them naman were inconclusive -- those who had resolutions were related to their checkout apps trying to add OOS add-ons to their customers' checkouts. Haven't seen a similar checkout customization in our Big Sale checkout kay Checkout Buddy also.

## Draft:

Hello and good day to your team!

I would like to inquire regarding our issue during checkouts. What seems to be happening with one of our customers is that even though they were able to still check out the items they needed in the end, they were met with a Out of Stock popup that says "some items are no longer available and have been removed from your cart". They haven't provided any further context if they clicked on "Continue checkout" or if they returned to their cart. We believe that the customer clicked on "Continue checkout" and trying anyways.

The odd thing is that when our team had investigated the issue, and more so on the inventory side, we haven't found anything that would throw the popup out to the customer (affected product and variant is attached to this message as screenshot proof), since the inventory for their specific variant they chose was indeed still on stock. We also have checked some points that were pointed out by some people on Shopify forums having similar popup problems, such as wrong shipping zone setups, which were all good on our side. Also, on other similar Shopify forum threads, they also said that this might be also caused by checkout-integrated apps that automatically adds some out of stock addons on the customer's cart, which was definitely not the case since we also do not have automatic addons on our checkout.

Here's the two things that we'd love to have answers to:
1. We'd like to know exactly what's happening on our backend, whether it's a caching issue (which we believe is the case given our areas of investigation), or if we ever missed anything during our own investigations.
2. What can we do to combat this issue moving forward, since this issue might bring frustration to other customers and might cause some revenue problems in the long run when it comes to customer retention.

Your inputs and insights on this matter would be very much appreciated!


Cheers,
Ken

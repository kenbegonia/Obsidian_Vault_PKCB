# Draft:

Hello and good day to your team!

I would like to inquire regarding the functionality of Product Discounts. To preface, our discount strategy is mainly reliant on Shopify Scripts, since our main discount point is that we'd have automatic script discounts for certain products, then let customers use discount codes for further savings. On Shopify Scripts plus the Discounts, this would've been stackable.

However, our team tried to replicate the stacked savings strategy through the Discounts alone, by using a discount code AND an automatic discount. We've observed that they do NOT stack, with the system prioritizing the bigger discount. 

Here are two things that we'd love to have answers to:
1. Is this functionality is expected for Discounts?
2. Would there be future planned features for Discounts that enables stores to have stacked auto and code product discounts, which kind of replicates what Scripts can do?

I'll be also attaching our observations. Your inputs and insights on this matter would be very much appreciated!


Cheers,
Ken

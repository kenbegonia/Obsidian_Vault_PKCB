Hello and good day to you and your team!

I'm writing this message to inquire something about this issue of ours regarding an inventory transfer. It seems that our items in the transfer (screenshots attached) are doubled up, like the same items that are "in transit" are also marked as "ready to be shipped". We also wanted to remove the items under "Ready to be shipped" but we weren't able to. What seems to be happening here? This particular transfer is the only transfer that had this issue as of recent. Inputs regarding this matter would be very much appreciated! If you need more details from us, please let us know.

Cheers,
Ken
